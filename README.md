What is the latest Guardian Headline New Aesthetic Version
==========================================================

A second version of the first 2nd Screen Guardian Headline viewer. This was called "New Aesthetic" just because
that was all getting started and a couple of us where throwing around large pixelated images with text over.
This one was supposed to be giant pixels but somewhere along the lines it's just become blurred.

I blame CSS.
